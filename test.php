			<h3>WHAT IS A MOTORCYCLE SUBSCRIPTION?</h3>
			<p>Motorcycle subscription is the simplest, most efficient and stress free way to enjoy your two wheels experience. You only pay for actually riding the motorcycle. Subscription removes the need to buy your own motorcycle (a depreciating asset) with your savings or worse by pay high interest rates, and subscription eliminates additional mandatory costs.</p>				
			<ul><h3>Know the advantages:</h3>
				<li>Your exclusive motorcycle</li>
				<li>Comprehensive insurance included in the subscription</li>
				<li>Maintenance and tyres covered</li>
				<li>Roadside assistance to your rescue in case of an emergency</li>
			</ul>
